This project is riddled with spaghetti code, and probably has numerous bugs and inefficiencies. I programmed this in an attempt to learn how basic reinforcement algorithms work, how topological sorts work, and how directed acyclic graphs can be used to represent a neural network.

Currently, the program is able to make a "rocket" hover along a single axis, and is able to sort by the highest-scoring network.

I plan to reuse some of the algorithms I wrote in this program in future applications.
